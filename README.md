BRIEF


Step 3: Some Tips!
How you attack this project is mostly up to you, but it is wise to begin by scaffolding out the structure of the page, and then take the various sections one by one.
The area behind the “ODIN” logo is a div that has a dark, but semi-transparent background color. This enhances the readability of the text against the busy background image.
The color we’ve chosen for the ‘Create Account’ button is similar to tones found in the background image. Specifically, it is #596D48.
The inputs, by default have a very light border (#E5E7EB), but we’ve included 2 variations. The “Last Name” input should be given a class of focus so that it can be styled with a blue border and a subtle box-shadow. The password inputs should be given an error class. Using a class for focus isn’t best practice, you’ll learn how to do that properly in a later lesson.
Do not worry about making your project look nice on mobile, but DO resize your browser a little bit to make sure that it’s not completely broken at different desktop resolutions.
